System information


- Local git master repository started in 'bracket-referee' directory, .gitignore added too
- Instructions for this are found at 
- To start the git, use 'git init' in desired folder
- Enter 'git status' to see that the new master branch exists
- It's best to add .gitignore after that, or else it could throw a fit if you have a merge conflict
- Enter 'ls -a' to confirm that .gitignore isn't already there
- If it isn't there, used 'touch .gitignore'
